# SnapLOVE

# Introduction

Worked in a crossfunctional team to implement a prototype feature for Snapchat at the Snap Academies. This feature, called SnapLOVE, promotes a social change. The social problem addressed is the lack of representation and inclusivity of BIPOC LGBTQ+ individuals. SnapLOVE is a Snap layer in Snap Map that allows its users to find resources and opportunities in their area.
